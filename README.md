# REGNOW

REGNOW is a cutting-edge course registration system designed specifically for Delhi Technological University (DTU) students, offering a seamless and efficient user experience. The project revolutionizes the traditional course registration process by automating enrollment and providing real-time seat updates, ensuring that students can quickly and easily register for their desired courses.

By leveraging the latest technologies, including ReactJS, NodeJS, Puppeteer, AWS, Cloudflare, Redux, and Supabase, REGNOW offers a modern and user-friendly interface that simplifies the registration process. The use of ReactJS provides a dynamic and responsive front-end, allowing students to navigate the system with ease. NodeJS powers the back-end logic, enabling complex computations and processes to be executed efficiently.

One of the key features of REGNOW is its automated enrollment functionality. The system automatically registers courses for students when the registration window opens, eliminating the need for manual intervention. Additionally, REGNOW uses websockets to provide real-time updates on course seat availability, ensuring that students have the latest information at their fingertips.

REGNOW also offers a proactive solution for students who may miss the opportunity to register for a course when seats are initially filled. The system continuously monitors course seats and, in the event that all seats become booked, REGNOW makes frequent requests to the DTU Academic server for course registration. This ensures that students are registered for a course as soon as a seat becomes available.

Overall, REGNOW transforms the course registration experience for DTU students by providing a faster, more efficient, and more reliable way to register for courses. The system's use of cutting-edge technologies and innovative features sets it apart from traditional course registration systems, making it a valuable tool for both students and administrators.
